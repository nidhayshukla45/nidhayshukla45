🌟 About Me

I’m a curious mind who loves turning ideas into real-world tech solutions. Whether it's crafting clean user interfaces or building intelligent systems with Python, I enjoy solving problems that actually make an impact.

I'm all about learning by doing—you'll often find me experimenting with full-stack projects or diving into machine learning algorithms to see what magic I can create.

🔍 Currently exploring:

💡 Full Stack Development – Django, PHP, HTML/CSS, MySQL

📈 Data Science & Machine Learning – Pandas, Scikit-learn, Regression Models

🗃️ Database Management – SQL, PL/SQL, Triggers, ER Diagrams

🔐 Cybersecurity Basics & Networking – Understanding how systems stay secure
